## Project Overview

Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for stakeholders in the real estate market, including buyers, sellers, and investors. This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The solution is designed for seamless integration and deployment in real-world applications.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhances model performance by creating relevant features.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes advanced regression algorithms for prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model accuracy using metrics like RMSE and R².
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Implements a pipeline for model deployment using tools like MLflow and Flask.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various attributes of houses, such as:

- **Lot Area**: Size of the lot in square feet.
- **Overall Quality**: Material and finish quality of the house.
- **Year Built**: Original construction date.
- **Total Rooms**: Number of rooms excluding bathrooms.
- **Garage Area**: Size of the garage in square feet.
- **Sale Price**: The property's sale price (target variable).

*Note: Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to use the dataset and comply with its licensing terms.*

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pijush2022/House-price-prediction-End-to-End-with-deployement.git
   cd House-price-prediction-End-to-End-with-deployement
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset and data loading scripts.
- `src/`: Includes source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `pipelines/`: Houses pipeline scripts for training and evaluation.
- `deployment/`: Contains files related to model deployment, such as Flask apps and configuration files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for managing project settings.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open `data_preprocessing.ipynb`.
   - Execute the cells to clean and preprocess the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Open `eda.ipynb` in the `notebooks/` directory.
   - Run the notebook to visualize data distributions and relationships.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Access `feature_engineering.ipynb` in the `notebooks/` directory.
   - Execute the cells to create and select meaningful features.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Open `model_training.ipynb` in the `notebooks/` directory.
   - Train the model and evaluate its performance using the provided metrics.

## Model Deployment

To deploy the trained model:

1. **Set Up MLflow Tracking**:
   - Ensure MLflow is installed and configured.
   - Use `mlflow ui` to launch the MLflow tracking server and monitor experiments.

2. **Deploy with Flask**:
   - Navigate to the `deployment/` directory.
   - Run the Flask application:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

*Note: For production deployment, consider using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Docker for scalability and reliability.*

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors.
- **R² Score**: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.

Detailed results and visualizations are available in the `results/` directory and the `model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook.
